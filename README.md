## Notes

I was able to add a search bar for an extra customization but the functionality is not implemented yet. I tried to do this but this messed up the current filters already set and was not displaying any of the games. I am still having trouble with getting the image size correctly as the example provided. 

Video Walktrough issues - I think it is too big of a file for ReadMe Github so it would not display the actual gif so I have provided a link instead.
